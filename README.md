# CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark

- This project is an excerpt from the CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark v4.0.0, a technical guide providing configuration settings to enhance the security of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources.
- It outlines numerous Recommendations across various security domains, such as Logging and Monitoring, Storage, and Cloud SQL Database Services, with each recommendation detailing a Rationale Statement, Impact Statement, and step-by-step Audit Procedure and Remediation Procedure for both the Google Cloud Console and CLI.
- The project classifies recommendations as either Automated or Manual and defines Level 1 and Level 2 security profiles, which offer varying degrees of security and impact on system utility. Furthermore, it includes appendices mapping these security recommendations to different versions and implementation groups of the CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls).
